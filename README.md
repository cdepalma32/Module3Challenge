# 🏗️ Module 3 Challenge

* This application updated JavaScript provided in challenge, with HTML and CSS files to get a password generator fully functioning by meeting alpha-numeric-symoblic criteria in order to create a strong password, providing greater security.  The character count of equal to or greater than 8 and equal to or less than 128 was also implemented.  The prompts were configured to confirm whether or not the character types would include (or not) lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers and special characters.
